# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

Hello, This is my first project for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), even though it was a small project but it was quite fun while making it. I'm looking forward to learn more and grow further.

### Built with

### Useful resources

- [Hub Spot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This helped me for centering div.
